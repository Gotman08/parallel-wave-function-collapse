## Parallel slowdown (omp t > 1 slower than serial)

Configurations where adding threads makes the code slower than serial. Diagnostic: indicates fork/join + sync cost > parallelizable work.

## Workload sensitivity

Does L (number of unique tiles) affect parallel efficiency?

| Size | binary_L11 | smooth_N3 | terrain_L33 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32x32 | 1.16× | 1.07× | 1.89× |
| 64x64 | 2.64× | 1.64× | 4.09× |
| 128x128 | 5.27× | 2.23× | 5.69× |
| 256x256 | 8.23× | not recorded | not recorded |

## Kokkos thread sensitivity

Kokkos solve times across 'thread' counts. The Kokkos backend
doesn't take a threads argument from `wfc_benchmark`; it uses
the default Kokkos host execution space concurrency. So all
'thread' columns should give the same result; if they do, this
documents that the kokkos sweep is effectively a single-config
run with statistical replicates rather than a scaling study.
